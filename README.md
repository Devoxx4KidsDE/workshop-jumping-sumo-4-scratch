## Introduction

This is a workshop that allows kids to control the Jumping Sumo with the [Scratch-Offline-Editor]. As you will see the kids have a lot of fun to play around with that jumping drone.


## Instructions

Everything you need is supplied within the download. Basically you need the following items

* The [Scratch-Offline-Editor] which you can just download and install for Mac or Windows
* The **bridge application** that allows Scratch to talk to the Jumping Sumo. It is part of this download. If you are interested to have a closer look at that application you can find the project [sumo4scratch] on github. The project again uses a library that implements the drone protocol which was implemented by [Tobias Schneider]
* An **extension for Scratch** to allow Scratch to know the commands for the Jumping sumo
* **Running Samples** how to use it within Scratch that can be found in [german](./Scratch/de/sumo-programm.sb2) or in [english](./Scratch/en/sumo-programm.sb2)
* a complete workshop that shows step by step instructions for the kids and the mentor



### Setup Scratch to Sumo4Scratch

*Language of the extension*: Two different extension files are provided for German and English.

[sumo4Scratch.s2e-german]:  https://github.com/Devoxx4KidsDE/sumo4scratch/tree/master/Scratch/de/sumo4Scratch_de.s2e
[sumo4Scratch.s2e-english]: https://github.com/Devoxx4KidsDE/sumo4scratch/tree/master/Scratch/en/sumo4Scratch_en.s2e

* Download the file [sumo4Scratch.s2e-german] or [sumo4Scratch.s2e-english] from github and save it at a convenient place as you need to open it from Scratch later on.
* You need to have the [Scratch-Offline-Editor] of Scratch running
* After you have started Scratch, open "File" while *holding SHIFT* at the same time. This reveals a secret menu entry "Import Experimental Extension". Now you can chose the file [sumo4Scratch.s2e-german] or [sumo4Scratch.s2e-english] which will be loaded by scratch.
* Then you can go to the "more block" section of script tab and you will recognize the Jumping Sumo section.
* Drop the blocks into the code and have fun.
* One more thing: of course you need to connect your wireless to the sumo first to be able to connect to it.

*Note:* In the current Scratch version I am using (445.2), extensions do not really have a complete support for localizations. Scratch seems to save the extension configuration in your program. See more at this description where I explained that [localization-behaviour].

## Using Sumo for Scratch

The usage of the blocks is straight forward and rather obvious.

* use the *Connection* Block first, when a scratch program is started. With the block you can define to which drone you like to connect. If you have only one drone, just go for the default.
* There is also a *Sumo off* with which you can disconnect that can be used. Of course, after that you need use the *Connect* again
* Now you can
	* Move in any direction (even with providing __speed and time__)
	* Turn by providing the angle in degrees
	* Jump high and far
	* Do some __tricks__

Note: Currently only command at a time is supported.

[sumo-programm_en.sb2]: https://github.com/Devoxx4KidsDE/sumo4scratch/tree/master/Scratch/en/sumo-programm.sb2

There is a __sample program__ for Scratch for __each__ language that you can find in the root directory of the project which is called [sumo-programm_de.sb2] or [sumo-programm_en.sb2] .

This is how it looks like in Scratch:
